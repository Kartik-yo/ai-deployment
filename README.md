# FastAPI AI Prompt Generator
### Created FastAPI backend:

Built a simple FastAPI app that receives a prompt via a form and returns a generated response.
Used Form to accept the prompt.
###  Set up Docker:

- Created a Dockerfile to containerize the FastAPI app.
- Dealt with errors related to missing dependencies (python-multipart) and model loading.

### Debugging:

- Solved model loading issue by verifying paths and dependencies.
- Ensured the server is running and accessible via port 5001.

### Troubleshooting:

- Checked for FastAPI route issues.
- Handled Docker container setup and model inclusion.

### Next Steps:

- Ensure model loading in the backend.
- Verify server and API routes are working properly.
